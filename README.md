# blocky_hash
Project for reading in blocks of a file and output md5 values of read in blocks.

Intended purpose is to track threat actor campaigns and then attempt to identify files with related blocks of code. 

V2 simply calculates the hashes. Comparisson is not done yet. Output is to text file and to sqliteDB.

python blocky_hash_V2_sqlite.py -h for help
